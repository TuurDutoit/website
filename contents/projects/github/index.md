## What can you find on my GitHub profile?
Almost all the code I write, I upload to GitHub. It's become a sort of portfolio. The majority of the repos are just small experiments, though, many of which I never finished. The ones that I have worked on a little more, and could be useful for other people, are documented on this website. So, have a look around, don't be shy!
