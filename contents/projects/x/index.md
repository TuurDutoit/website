## About
I love jQuery. It truly is an amazing thing, making so many common tasks so much easier. But it has some drawbacks. The biggest one being its filesize: a minified jQuery script easily takes up 80kB, which is a lot for a script.

The main reason for this huge size, is that jQuery supports many browsers, too many, and has lots of features. So one day, I began making a sort of lightweight replacement. I didn't care too much about browser support and I only wanted the basic features.

Unfortunately, I got bored and distracted by other projects and stopped developement.
